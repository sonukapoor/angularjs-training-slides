## Model View Controller (MVC) Framework

![Simple MVC](content/images/simple-mvc.svg) 

- Consists of three major parts (Model / View / Controller)

- Mostly used in traditional server side languages
- Model => Contains the data and logic
- View => Visual layout of your page
- Controller => Updates the view or model
